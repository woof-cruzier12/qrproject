# This file contains error messages which are shown to user, when http/https
# login is used.
# These messages can be changed to make user interface more friendly, including
# translations to different languages.
#
# Various variables can be used here as well. Most frequently used ones are:
#	$(error-orig)	- original error message from hotspot
#	$(ip)		- ip address of a client
#	$(username)	- username of client trying to log in

# internal-error
# It should never happen. If it will, error page will be shown
# displaying this error message (error-orig will describe what has happened)

internal-error = internal error ($(error-orig))

# config-error
# Should never happen if hotspot is configured properly.

config-error = configuration error ($(error-orig))

# not-logged-in
# Will happen, if status or logout page is requested by user,
# which actually is not logged in

not-logged-in = you are not logged in (ip $(ip))

# ippool-empty
# IP address for user is to be assigned from ip pool, but there are no more
# addresses in that pool

# shutting-down
# When shutdown is executed, new clients are not accepted

# user-session-limit
# If user profile has limit of shared-users, then this error will be shown
# after reaching this limit

# one or another amount. If this limit is reached, following error is displayed.

# a MAC address of this client, login is rejected

wrong-mac-username = invalid username ($(username)): this MAC address is not yours

# chap-missing
# If http-chap login method is used, but hotspot program does not receive
# back encrypted password, this error message is shown.
# Possible reasons of failure:
#	- JavaScript is not enabled in web browser;
#	- login.html page is not valid;
#	- challenge value has expired on server (more than 1h of inactivity);
#	- http-chap login method is recently removed;
# If JavaScript is enabled and login.html page is valid,
# then retrying to login usually fixes this problem.

chap-missing = Gumamit ng Chrome browser at ulitin ang pag-log-in.

# has sent an error string with Access-Reject message, then it will
